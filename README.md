# PHP Basic Exercises Repository

Welcome to my PHP Basic Exercises repository! This repository contains a collection of simple exercises that I completed during my journey through the 
IT Academy Bootcamp. These exercises were designed to help me learn and practice the fundamental concepts of PHP programming, focusing on the introductory 
weeks of the bootcamp. They cover basic programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and more.

## What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find a set of PHP scripts that I worked on during the IT Academy Bootcamp. These exercises include:

- **Loop Structures:** Exercises that helped me practice using `for`, `while`, and `foreach` loops to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks.
- **Conditional Statements:** Tasks that allowed me to practice making decisions in my code using `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements.
- **Functions:** Challenges that helped me understand how to define functions and use them to organize my code.
- **Arrays:** Exercises that involved working with arrays, both indexed and associative, to store and manipulate collections of data.
- **Basic Input and Output:** Tasks that taught me how to take user input and display output in a user-friendly manner.

## How to Use

Since these exercises were part of my learning journey, you're welcome to explore the solutions I developed.
